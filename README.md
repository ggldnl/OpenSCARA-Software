# OpenSCARA Software

This repository contains the software that should run on the SCARA. The hardware is based on an Arduino Uno board + CNC shield.

For a complete overview of the project, refer to the [main OpenSCARA repository](https://github.com/ggldnl/OpenSCARA). 

## üìù Notes

1. If you plan to use other boards (e.g. Arduino Mega + RAMPS), you should change the config file.

2. You can easily adjust the parameters regarding the kinematic structure, in case you modify the 3d models, without having to edit the code - just use the config.
